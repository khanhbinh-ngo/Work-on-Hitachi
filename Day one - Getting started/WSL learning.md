- store file with the isolated linux file system. 
- run common bash command line (grep, sed, awk) or soth, we can also run bash scripts and GNU/linux command line
    - vim, emacs, tmux
    - language: nodejs, javascripts and soon
    - services: sshd ,mysql, apache, mongodb and full ver of postgresql
- install additional software
