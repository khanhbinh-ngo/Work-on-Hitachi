## I. What is WSL

- a feature of windows 
- allow to run a linux environment on your windows machine
- without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting (maybe)

## II. How does it work?

- install and run various linux distributions
- store files in an isolated linux file system (specific to the installed distributions)
1. Subsystem Integration:
- I mean, we can use directly windows but install other OS, like linux distributions (fuckin good based on how we work with those OS)
- store file with the isolated linux file system. 
- run common bash command line (grep, sed, awk) or soth, we can also run bash scripts and GNU/linux command line
    - vim, emacs, tmux
    - language: nodejs, javascripts and soon
    - services: sshd ,mysql, apache, mongodb and full ver of postgresql
- install additional software


## III. HOw to work with?
1. concept:

- working across the file system
- advanced settings configuration
- file access and permission 
- user systemd to manage services
